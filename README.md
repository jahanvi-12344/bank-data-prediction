Bank Data Clustering Project (Clustering - Unsupervised Learning)
Objective:
Segment bank customers into clusters based on similarities to derive insights and enhance customer management strategies.

Steps:

Data Collection:

Obtain bank customer data including DD,Withdrawals,Deposits,Branch Area in sqft,avg daily walkins.
Data Preprocessing:

Clean Data: Remove outliers and irrelevant fields.
Handle Missing Values: Use appropriate methods to fill or exclude missing entries.
Normalize Data: Standardize features to ensure all variables contribute equally.

Feature Engineering:
applied colliniarty between the features
Perform feature scaling and encode categorical variables.

Model Training:
Use clustering algorithm K-Means.
Determine the optimal number of clusters using techniques like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score.

Cluster Analysis:
Group customers into clusters and analyze their characteristics.
